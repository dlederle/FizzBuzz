I've seen [this classic post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html) several times, and always scoffed.
Then I realized I had never actually done it.
Now I have.

##Differences
JS was very straightforward, although I forgot to go to 100 since it was the first one I did.
Java was basically the same code, except getting the code to compile was a little harder, since I forgot about class matching filename, having a main(), etc.
Ruby was super simple, but formatting the output the way I wanted took a couple tries. 
php made it simple to add the space between the numbers.

I wanted to do it in CLISP since I'm learning that right now, but I have to figure out how to source files properly, since I only use a REPL right now.
